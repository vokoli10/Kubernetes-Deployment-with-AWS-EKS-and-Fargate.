# Kubernetes-Deployment-with-AWS-EKS-and-Fargate.
This guide provides step-by-step instructions. We will travel through the complexities of AWS EKS together. However, we will not end there. We'll take it a notch further by combining it with Fargate, a serverless computation engine for containers, and also dive into the details of Kubernetes deployment and Ingress configuration.

## Prerequisite
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account
